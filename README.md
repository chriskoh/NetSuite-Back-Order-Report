Backorder Summary Report

The Backorder Summary Report reviews all sales orders that have any backordered lines. This report provides a summary of each order, including order number, customer name and number, salesperson, order type, order date, the last date that items were shipped for the order, and the total monetary amounts ordered, shipped and backordered.
Your salespeople can use this report to identify which of their orders have backordered lines and the pending revenue amounts due from the backorders. Management may also want to use this report to identify the total monetary amounts outstanding in backorders.
